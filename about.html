            Hello :)
            </h2>
                <p>
                    Thanks for visiting my About page. I was born in Switzerland but grew up in the Northeast where I started rowing in highschool and it became 
                    my passion. The valuable lessons I have learned from rowing have helped me to succeed in my endeavours both in and outside of the classroom.
