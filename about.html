            Hello :)
            </h2>
                <p>
                    Thanks for visiting my About page. I was born in Switzerland but grew up in the Northeast where I started rowing in highschool and it became 
                    my passion. The valuable lessons I have learned from rowing have helped me to succeed in my endeavours both in and outside of the classroom.

            Rowing has given me a work ethic and a multitude of life lessons that has helped me in every discipline I have pursued. It taught me the true power
            of hard work, dedication, and patience. I struggled a lot during my first semester at university; I was unsure of what to major in, I hadn't performed
            as well as I would have liked in rowing, and I was missing many of my friends from home. I decided that I needed a win. Having only ever ran approximately
            8 miles before, I impuslively signed up to run the Philadelphia marathon with only 4 weeks to train. I ran everyday while simultaneously attending 4:30 AM
            crew practice and balancing a busy course load. I worked my way up to running 20 miles the weekend before the race and I ended up completing it in 3:42. 
            This accomplishment reinforced in me the importance of goal setting and dedication and how rewarding it can be.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            After taking the spring semester of my freshmen year off I traveled to my home country of Switzerland where I had the amazing opportunity to stay 
            with my family where I could work on a construction site and race at regattas. I met some amazing people on both the construction sites and my rowing 
            team, <strong><a target="_blank" href="https://www.ruderclub-schaffhausen.ch/"> Ruder Club Schaffhausen</a></strong>. My coach, Ueli, was one of the 
            most inspirational and the wisest human being I have ever met and getting coached by him was a truly humbling experience. I am truly grateful and
            honored to have called him my coach and I only could have met him through rowing. His elite coaching reinvigorated my passion for rowing and I ended 
            up returning the following summer to once again race with them. From working on construction sites to racing at many high-profile regattas such as the 
            Swiss Championships, I was also able to connect with my country on a much greater level.
