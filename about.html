                    Thanks for visiting my About page. I was born in Switzerland but grew up in the Northeast where I started rowing in highschool and it became 
                    my passion. The valuable lessons I have learned from rowing have helped me to succeed in my endeavours both in and outside of the classroom.

            When I am not studying or programming I enjoy snowboarding, running, and hiking. Most recently I have started creating art with python using
            <strong><a target="_blank" href="https://processing.org/"> Processing</a></strong>. Check out some of the art I generated below! I have also 
            been getting into astrophotography.
