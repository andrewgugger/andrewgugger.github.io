            I was initially supposed to begin my internship at the end of May but there was a delayed start due to HR complications brought on by COVID. 
            Nevertheless, over the course of the 7 weeks that I worked for TMHCC remotely I received a ton of not only industry knowledge, but also gained valuable 
            insight into the function of IT in a big company. During my internship, I worked on a major policy and claims administration system replacement 
            project for the Public Risk Group. <span class="read-more-target">I contributed by providing quality assurance for system configurations made in the
            Infinity Database Configuration Manager and documenting modifications to help sync these across test and production environments. 
            This required me to learn the structure of the
            database whilst conducting QA and then communicating my findings to my mentors and co-workers. I also had the opportunity to sit in 
            on presentations given 
            by vendors that license could-based-technology that allows companies to build scalable web applications without any programming knowledge. These meetings gave
            me invaluable insight into how IT will be building applications throughout all industries in the future.
            <br/> <br/>
            
            Another project I contributed to gave me the opportunity to develop a tool that allowed TMHCC to test their rating engines for calculating premium.
            For each line of business, the rating engines would calculate the premium based on many different factors. As I grew my familiarity with how 
            the rating engine worked, my mentor provided me with the opportunity to work more
            independently on the project. I created documentation that detailed how the tool worked as well as the modifications needed when working on a different rating
            engine. There were many unforeseen obstacles that were thrown my way when working on this project, however, it gave me the opportunity to refine my workflow
            optimization and problem-solving abilities. </span>

            On March 1, 2020, a new bag waste reduction law took effect in New York State - where over 23 billion plastic bags are used each year. Plastic bag usage
            affects both our communities and environment. They can be seen stuck in trees, as litter in our neighborhoods, and floating in our waterways. My brothers
            and I started <a target="_blank" href="https://www.newyorkrelic.com/"><strong>New York Relic</strong></a> in the wake of the ban with the mission to provide reusable carry bags inspired by the iconic designs found on the plastic 
            bags of New York. On top of pursuing my degree and rowing, we have been working around the clock fulfilling orders, creating designs, and utilizing social
            media for guerilla marketing.

            In order to finance my rowing training and competing in Switzerland I worked construction whilst attending practice in the evenings. The construction 
            site forced me to adapt quickly and learn different jobs all the while communicating in German where I initially had limited proficiency. This was often
            challenging and I had to learn how to problem solve quickly, not just to complete specific tasks, but also to manage my relationships with my supervisors 
            and co-workers who were not necessarily understanding of my situation. I worked on a variety of contracting jobs including electrical wiring 
            installations, minor demolitions, insulation, Stonemasonry and others. Much of the work was incredibly labor intensive and reuqired me to constantly
            think on my feet when things did not go to plan. This experience taught me a lot when it comes to improvising and making the most of the resources at my
            disposal - skills that I have utilized in all aspects of my professional career.

            The NEST was an idea that the MIS Department Chair came up with to try and build a sense of community/belonging for incoming MIS majors since classes
            were moved online due to COVID. One of my professors reached out to me over the summer with the opportunity of being a "NEST Leader" where myself and
            one other NEST Leader would be in charge providing social, community, and academic support to a group of about 10 freshmen MIS majors. I came up with 
            ideas for activies to get students engaged and socializing with one another, provided tutoring as well as mentoring as they navigated their first semester
            of university.
