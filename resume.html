            On March 1, 2020, a new bag waste reduction law took effect in New York State - where over 23 billion plastic bags are used each year. Plastic bag usage
            affects both our communities and environment. They can be seen stuck in trees, as litter in our neighborhoods, and floating in our waterways. My brothers
            and I started <a target="_blank" href="https://bafybeiem7f55i2h42ljd3bm62ypqg2abuh5gc2hfypvzc5hfkts5bnsrpy.ipfs.dweb.link/"><strong>New York Relic</strong></a> in the wake of the ban with the mission to provide reusable carry bags inspired by the iconic designs found on the plastic 
            bags of New York. On top of pursuing my degree and rowing, we have been working around the clock fulfilling orders, creating designs, and utilizing social
            media for guerilla marketing.

            In order to finance my rowing training and competing in Switzerland I worked construction whilst attending practice in the evenings. The construction 
            site forced me to adapt quickly and learn different jobs all the while communicating in German where I initially had limited proficiency. This was often
            challenging and I had to learn how to problem solve quickly, not just to complete specific tasks, but also to manage my relationships with my supervisors 
            and co-workers who were not necessarily understanding of my situation. I worked on a variety of contracting jobs including electrical wiring 
            installations, minor demolitions, insulation, Stonemasonry and others. Much of the work was incredibly labor intensive and reuqired me to constantly
            think on my feet when things did not go to plan. This experience taught me a lot when it comes to improvising and making the most of the resources at my
            disposal - skills that I have utilized in all aspects of my professional career.

            The NEST was an idea that the MIS Department Chair came up with to try and build a sense of community/belonging for incoming MIS majors since classes
            were moved online due to COVID. One of my professors reached out to me over the summer with the opportunity of being a "NEST Leader" where myself and
            one other NEST Leader would be in charge providing social, community, and academic support to a group of about 10 freshmen MIS majors. I came up with activies 
            to get students engaged and socializing with one another, provided tutoring as well as mentoring as they navigated their first semester
            of university.
