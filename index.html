                Hi, my name is Andrew Gugger and I am a senior at the <a target="_blank" href="https://lerner.udel.edu"><strong>University of Delaware's Alfred
                Lerner College of Business and Economics</strong></a>, pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Management Information Systems and am Minoring in Computer Science and Business 
                Analytics. I look forward to exploring the many facets of IT and have interests in DBM design, web-development, and cybersecurity. I honed my positive 
                work ethic while working on construction sites in Switzerland, and being on a collegiate rowing team as well as racing internationally has taught me the importance of teamwork. <a href="about.html"> <strong>Click here to learn more about me.</strong></a>

            The average college student produces a whopping 640 pounds of trash annually, the majority of which accumulates at the end of the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sg465Igbxyw&t=205s"><strong>end of the year during move-out</strong></a>.
            A large portion of this trash consists of items that have not reached their full life-span - stuff like microwaves, minifridges, textbooks, laptops, furniture, etc.
            Furthermore, the turn-over time for moving into a dorm as a first-year student or even graduating and having to move out is so fast that it's not worth it for most 
            people to list their housing amenities on traditional online marketplaces such as ebay or craigslist. I had the idea for <a target="_blank" href="https://www.sloppy2nd.com/"><strong>Sloppy2nd</strong></a> two years ago when I saw how 
            many of the seniors on our team would resolve to throwing their stuff away or giving it to underclassmen on the team. Freshmen moving in would then buy all the
            necessary amenities  brand new and the cycle would repeat. There needed to be a centralized website where only students at the University of Delaware could buy and sell their "Sloppy2nd" textbooks, 
            microwaves, couches, etc. I built Sloppy2nd during the Summer of 2021 using the web-framework Django while simultaneously working a full time-internship as a front-end web developer.
            The mission of Sloppy2nd is to help curb student waste while simultaneously lightening the financial load by giving students the opportunity to buy "sloppy2nds" from each other.
            Sloppy2nd uses the gmail API to authenticate its users and you must have an @udel.edu email to register so if you would like a demo, please shoot me an <a href="mailto: agugger@udel.edu"><strong>email</strong></a>
            or reach out to me on <a target ="_blank" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrewgugger/"><strong>linkedin</strong></a>.

            On March 1, 2020, a new bag waste reduction law took effect in New York State - where over 23 billion plastic bags are used each year. Plastic bag usage
            affects both our communities and environment. They can be seen stuck in trees, as litter in our neighborhoods, and floating in our waterways. My brothers
            and I started <a target="_blank" href="https://bafybeiem7f55i2h42ljd3bm62ypqg2abuh5gc2hfypvzc5hfkts5bnsrpy.ipfs.dweb.link/"><strong>New York Relic</strong></a> in 
            the wake of the ban with the mission to provide reusable carry bags inspired by the iconic designs found on the plastic 
            bags of New York. After months of fulfilling orders, creating designs and utilizing social-media for guerilla marketing, we had to take the store down
            due to the shut down of our print providers and many other issues brought on by COVID-19. We are now hosting a simple landing page on IPFS using a .crypto domain.
